### Closures: Fundamental Concepts

#### 1\. Functions as First-Class Citizens:

-   In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens, which means they can be:
    -   Assigned to variables.
    -   Passed as arguments to other functions.
    -   Returned from other functions.



```javascript
const greet = function(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

const sayHello = greet;
console.log(sayHello('John')); // Output: Hello, John!
```

#### 2\. Lexical Scoping and Scope Chain:

-   Lexical scoping refers to how the JavaScript interpreter resolves variable names based on the location where the variable is declared.
-   The scope chain is the hierarchy of scopes that determines the order in which the interpreter looks up variables.



```javascript
function outer() {
    const outerVar = 'I am from outer';

    function inner() {
        console.log(outerVar); // Accessing outerVar from the outer scope
    }

    inner();
}

outer();
```

#### 3\. Variable Environment and Hoisting:

-   Variable environment refers to the context in which variables are declared.
-   Hoisting involves the automatic lifting of variable and function declarations to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.



```javascript
function hoistingExample() {
    console.log(x); // undefined
    var x = 5;
    console.log(x); // 5
}
```

#### 4\. The 'this' Keyword:

-   The behavior of the `this` keyword depends on how a function is invoked:
    -   In the global scope, `this` refers to the global object (e.g., `window` in a browser).
    -   In a method, `this` refers to the object that the method was called on.



```javascript
function exampleFunction() {
    console.log(this); // 'this' refers to the global object
}

const obj = {
    method: function() {
        console.log(this); // 'this' refers to the object (obj)
    }
};

exampleFunction();
obj.method();
```

#### 5\. Callbacks and Higher-Order Functions:

-   Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions, often used in asynchronous operations.
-   Higher-order functions are functions that can accept other functions as parameters or return them.



```javascript
function higherOrderFunction(callback) {
    console.log('Before callback');
    callback();
    console.log('After callback');
}

function callbackFunction() {
    console.log('Inside callback');
}

higherOrderFunction(callbackFunction);
```

#### 6\. Anonymous Functions and Closures:

-   Anonymous functions do not have a name and are often used as arguments to other functions.
-   Closures are formed when a function is defined inside another function, allowing access to the outer function's variables even after the outer function has finished executing.



```javascript
function outerFunction() {
    const outerVar = 'I am from outer';

    return function() {
        console.log(outerVar); // Accessing outerVar from the closure
    };
}

const closureFunction = outerFunction();
closureFunction();
```

By mastering these foundational concepts, you'll be well-equipped to explore closures and their applications in JavaScript.
